# Library_System_SpringBootJava
This Spring Boot-powered library system allows Librarians with book management and member control. Members can browse, borrow, and return books, with real-time status updates. Account deletion for members is also included. This project utilizes my proficiency in REST practices, SOLID principles, design patterns, and TDD/BDD methodologies.
